ctf-pwn
=======

**Note**: This is (still) old code, which partially sucks. But it should provide a brief understanding on what may be done. There is a lot of room for improvements.


A simple offensive framework for attack/defense CTFs. It takes care of running exploits and flag submission. Mainly for preventing loss of flags due to unreachable gameservers.

**TODO**:

* Create `supervisor` configuration to handle starting/stopping of both services. 
+ Add info of new structure to `README.md`.
